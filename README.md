## Web scraping and dashboards creation

This project is the first in my portfolio.  

In this project I web scrape data from the [WHO](https://platform.who.int/mortality/themes/theme-details/MDB/all-causes) website, process the information received and build a [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/9401dde2-a509-4cf8-bac6-d483c9280549/page/p_962rte2a6c?s=gHN_Zzz2Zrc) to visualize the dynamics of changes in mortality in European countries in the 21st century.  

The goal of the project is to demonstrate mastery of the following skills and tools:
- Python (main libraries: Selenium, Pandas, Seaborn);
- processing, verification, cleaning of data;
- building dashboards (Google Data Studio).
